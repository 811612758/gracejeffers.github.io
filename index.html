  <div><p class="color" class="column" style="background-color:#ccc;"><i> The below picture is from my nannying experience. Considering that I nannied for incredibly rich doctors,
this job was not challenging. I made 12 dollars an hour plus gas money,
I was allowed to eat anything they had, and I got to enjoy their
luxurios pool. Not to mention, the kids were fabulous. There were three kids, a thirteen
year old, a  fifthteen year old, and a seventeen year old. Since they 
were on the older side, I am still friends with them to this day. I know
it sounds weird and unusual that I babysat such old kids, and it 
kind of was at firtst. But I was more like their mom's secretary
and a chauffeur for the two younger kids. Also, someone there at 
the mantion to make sure things ran smoothly. </i></p></div>

	<h3 class= "shadow"> Day In A Life Of An Intern </h3>
<div><p class="color" class="column" style="background-color:#bbb;"><i> I had an internship this summer in Chicago at GovHR.USA. 
Even though it was a very far drive from my house, it was still
convenient for me since I have family that lives in Chicago. 
I lived with my aunt, uncle, and cousins and had a 30 min 
commute to work everyday. I worked a 9 to 4 work day and mostly 
sat at a desk doing odds and ends of work the company needed during the day.
My main work during this internship was making excel sheets for
projects they were working on, or doing research on potential 
employees for different jobs. Below are listed some other duties 
I had as well. Overall, this was a great experience and I learned
a lot of real life skills that will be beneficial to me.
My favorite part, however, was the Marianos grocery store that 
was right by it!</i></p></div>

<h3 class= "shadow"> Day In A Life Of An ADPI </h3>
<div><p class="color" class="column" style="background-color:#aaa;"><i>Being in ADPI is great, but recruitment is one of the longest 
and draining (emotionally and physically) events I have ever
been apart of. It starts August first, so this past summer I went straight from my
internship to, basically, living at the ADPI house. The week before
the freeshman come, we practice and prepare everyhting you can 
imagine. Once they get here, the days somehow merge together and
the week feels like one big day with never-ending conversations
and smiling. By the time it's over, everyone is ready to sleep for
a soild two months and there are too many pictures to count.
Below is a link to my facebook that shows just how many pictures 
I was tagged in over the span of one week.</i></p></div>
